# Publishing as a Standard Open Linked Data Model
This quick start guide will show you how to create a more advanced processing pipeline in the [LDIO Workbench](https://informatievlaanderen.github.io/VSDS-Linked-Data-Interactions/) for converting our example model to a [standard open vocabulary](https://github.com/vocol/mobivoc) and to publish that as a [Linked Data Event Stream (LDES)](https://semiceu.github.io/LinkedDataEventStreams/).

Please see the [introduction](../README.md) for the example data set and pre-requisites, as well as an overview of all examples.

## Copy & Paste Rules!
To kickstart this tutorial we can use the [basic setup tutorial](./basic-setup/README.md).

For the server we only will need to change the actual model. Everything else can stay the same: we will still need to volume mount the server configuration file and provide the database connection string (which we have changed to reflect our tutorial).

The workbench is where we need to change a few things: we'll need to transform our custom model to the standard vocabulary. To make it a bit more interesting we'll start from an actual real-time message which contains more than one state object. In fact, we'll be checking for changes on a regular basis. Now we have a real linked data event stream!

## Towards a More Advanced Model
As mentioned above, we'll be using an open vocabulary standard to describe our model. This allows us to attach real semantic meaning to it and create interoperability with other Data Publishers that use the same vocabulary.

Understanding and mapping our [source model](https://data.stad.gent/explore/dataset/real-time-bezetting-pr-gent/information/) (check out the dataset schema) to the [target model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vocol/mobivoc/develop/diagrams/mobivoc_v1.1.4.png) is the hard part, in particular if we are missing descriptions for the model structure and its properties. Lucky for us, most of the property names are more-or-less self-explanatory.

|source property|meaning|
|-|-|
|name|descriptive name|
|lastupdate|timestamp when last updated|
|type|type of parking facility, always `offStreetParkingGround`|
|openingtimesdescription|description of opening times|
|isopennow|is parking currently open? specified as boolean: yes = 1, no = 0|
|temporaryclosed|is parking temporary closed? (boolean)|
|operatorinformation|description of company operating the parking|
|freeparking|is parking freely accessable? (boolean)|
|urllinkaddress|webpage URL of the parking offering more information|
|numberofspaces|total number of spaces (capacity)|
|availablespaces|available number of spaces|
|occupancytrend|?|
|occupation|amount of occupied spaces expressed as a rounded percentage of the capacity|
|latitude|north-south position of the parking|
|longitude|east-west position of the parking|
|location.lon|same as longitude but expressed as a number|
|location.lat|same as latitude but expressed as a number|
|gentse_feesten|?|

As you can see, except for a few, we have a pretty good idea of the meaning of the properties. Obviously we should double-check our assumptions with the publisher of this data. For this tutorial, we'll assume that the meaning is correct and that we can ignore the few unclear properties. So, let's continue by looking into how these properties map onto the Mobivoc model.

Looking at the Mobivoc model we notice a central entity named _parking facility_. It derives from a _civic structure_ inheriting its properties. We can also see that there is an entity _parking lot_ derived from a _parking facility_ and is essentially the same as our offstreet parking ground. Following the _civic structure_ relations we see that it can have a _capacity_ and a _real time capacity_ (derived from _capacity_). Exactly what we need! Furthermore, a _capacity_ is valid for a vehicle type, a _civic structure_ has an _opening hours specification_ and is operated by an _organization_. Let's create a mapping from our source model to the target model based on this knowledge.

> **Note** that for readability we use well-known abbreviations for the namespaces used in the properties and values. 

|source|target|
|-|-|
|name _value_|rdfs:label _value_|
|lastupdate _value_|dct:modified _value_|
|type offStreetParkingGround|rdf:type mv:ParkingLot|
|openingtimesdescription _value_|schema:openingHoursSpecification [rdf:type schema:OpeningHoursSpecification; rdfs:label _value_]|
|isopennow _value_|_N/A_|
|temporaryclosed _value_|_N/A_|
|operatorinformation _value_|mv:operatedBy [rdf:type schema:Organization, dct:Agent; rdfs:label _value_]|
|freeparking _value_|mv:price [rdf:type schema:PriceSpecification; mv:freeOfCharge _value_]|
|urllinkaddress _value_|mv:url _value_|
|numberofspaces _value_|mv:capacity [rdf:type mv:Capacity; mv:totalCapacity _value_]|
|availablespaces _value_|mv:capacity [rdf:type mv:RealTimeCapacity; mv:currentValue _value_]|
|occupancytrend _value_|_N/A_|
|occupation _value_|mv:rateOfOccupancy _value_|
|latitude _value_|geo:lat _value_|
|longitude _value_|geo:long _value_|
|location.lon|_N/A_|
|location.lat|_N/A_|
|gentse_feesten _value_|_N/A_|

> **Note** that we mark some mappings as not applicable (_N/A_) because we cannot map a property, we do not known the exact meaning of the property or we do not need it (e.g. duplicates).

Great! We have determined what will be mapped and how. We're done. Well, not quite. There is one more thing we need: an identity for our entity. It has to be an URI and obviously it needs to be unique. In addition, for every update of the available spaces the identity should remain the same (duh!). So, what do we use for the identity? One possible option is to take the `urllinkaddress` value. It would work as long as the Data Owner does not decide to relocate it. Best option is to check with the Data Owner but for this tutorial we'll continue on the assumption that the `urllinkaddress` will not change.

## To Push or To Pull, That's the Question
As mention above, to make it more interesting we will be retrieving the number of available spaces in our parking lots on a regular interval. To do so we can use a component that can poll one or more URLs using HTTP. To do so, we need to replace the `LdioHttpIn` component (push model) that listens for incoming HTTP requests by a `LdioHttpInPoller` component (pull model).

For example, to poll our source URL every two minutes we need to configure our pipeline input as:
```yaml
input:
  name: be.vlaanderen.informatievlaanderen.ldes.ldio.LdioHttpInPoller
  config:
    url: https://data.stad.gent/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/real-time-bezetting-pr-gent/exports/csv?lang=en&timezone=Europe%2FBrussels
    interval: PT1M
```

This will ensure we receive the actual state of our parking lots at regular time intervals, which may or may not have changed since the last time we checked.

> **Note** that we request the data as CSV but alternatively we could have used JSON or GeoJSON. We still need to configure an adapter to convert the received CSV message to linked data. We'll do that next.

## With a Little Help From Our Pirates
Now that we can get the actual state of our parking lots, we need to convert the source message in semicolon (`;`) separated CSV format to the linked data models we defined in the mapping. For this we can use a technology called [RDF Mapping Language](https://rml.io) (RML). There are various ways to produce the mapping that we need: directly using linked data which defines the [RML mapping rules](https://rml.io/specs/rml/) or indirectly using a more human readable way named [Yarrrml](https://rml.io/yarrrml/). Personally I prefer the real thing but using [Matey](https://rml.io/yarrrml/matey/) may be more your thing.

Explaining the RML technology is beyond the scope of this tutorial. The technology allows us to convert formats such as CSV, XML and JSON into complex RDF models. However, using it to create these complex models can be quite challenging. The solution is to do a straight forward mapping and create the structure we need in a second phase. Basically we map the properties of our source model one-to-one into an intermediate linked data model and then transform this intermediate model into our final model using another RDF technology (SPARQL construct), which is way easier to use for creating complex structures. We'll do this in the next section.

We start by creating a simple intermediate model where we already set the correct identity and entity type but map everything else as-is onto an intermediate vocabulary (`temp:` or `https://temp.org/ns/advanced-compose#` in full).

|source|intermediate|
|-|-|
|name _value_|temp:name _value_|
|lastupdate _value_|temp:lastupdate _value_|
|type offStreetParkingGround|rdf:type mv:ParkingLot|
|openingtimesdescription _value_|temp:openingtimesdescription _value_|
|operatorinformation _value_|temp:operatorinformation _value_|
|freeparking _value_|temp:freeparking _value_|
|urllinkaddress _id_|_id_|
|numberofspaces _value_|temp:numberofspaces _value_|
|availablespaces _value_|temp:availablespaces _value_|
|occupation _value_|temp:occupation _value_|
|latitude _value_|temp:latitude _value_|
|longitude _value_|temp:longitude _value_|

To create a RML mapping file we need to write the RML rules in [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/). All the Turtle prefixes should go at the start of the file but for simplicity we'll add the prefixes as we go. Let's start with the most common ones:

```text
@prefix rdf:    <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rml:    <http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/rml#> .
@prefix rr:     <http://www.w3.org/ns/r2rml#> .
@prefix ql:     <http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/ql#> .
@prefix carml:  <http://carml.taxonic.com/carml/> .
```

> **Note** that the last one is always needed for our RML adapter component (`RmlAdaptor`).

Now, we start by defining the map which will contain our mapping rules. We define a prefix for our map and rules (`:`) and tell the RML component that we will be mapping CSV messages. Do not forget that all prefixes go at the start before our mapping and rules.

```text
@prefix :       <https://example.org/ns/tutorial/advanced-conversion#> .

:TriplesMap a rr:TriplesMap;
  rml:logicalSource [
    a rml:LogicalSource;
    rml:source [ a carml:Stream ];
    rml:referenceFormulation ql:CSV
  ].
```

Let's continue now with defining the identity and type of our parking lots. Remember that for the identity we use the URL value and for the type we use _parking lot_. At the same time we'll also add each _parking lot_ in its own graph. Say what? We'll learn about triples and graphs a bit later. For now, just remember that we want to handle each _parking lot_  separately so we instruct the RML component to generate a stream of `mv:ParkingLot` entities, one for each row in the CSV.

```text
@prefix mv:     <http://schema.mobivoc.org/#> .

:TriplesMap rr:subjectMap [
  rr:graphMap [ rr:template "{urllinkaddress}" ];
  rml:reference "urllinkaddress";
  rr:class mv:ParkingLot
].
```

Easy enough. No? Let's continue with one property. We define a rule saying that the entity will have a property (predicate) named `temp:name` whose value (object) comes from the source property `name`.

```text
@prefix rdfs:   <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix temp:   <https://temp.org/ns/advanced-compose#> .

:TriplesMap rr:predicateObjectMap [
  rr:predicate temp:name;
  rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "name" ]
].
```

Again, no rocket-science once you get used to the Turtle and RML syntax.

Let's do the other properties as well. We define a rule to map each source property value onto the intermediate property. However, to make our life a bit easier in the next step, where we convert the intermediate to the target model, we can already add the correct value types.

```text
:TriplesMap rr:predicateObjectMap [
  rr:predicate temp:lastupdate;
  rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "lastupdate"; rr:datatype xsd:dateTime ]
], [
  rr:predicate temp:openingtimesdescription;
  rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "openingtimesdescription" ]
], [
  rr:predicate temp:operatorinformation;
  rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "operatorinformation" ]
], [
  rr:predicate temp:freeparking;
  rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "freeparking"; rr:datatype xsd:integer ]
], [
  rr:predicate temp:numberofspaces;
  rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "numberofspaces"; rr:datatype xsd:integer ]
], [
  rr:predicate temp:availablespaces;
  rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "availablespaces"; rr:datatype xsd:integer ]
], [
  rr:predicate temp:occupation;
  rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "occupation"; rr:datatype xsd:integer ]
], [
  rr:predicate temp:latitude;
  rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "latitude"; rr:datatype xsd:double ]
], [
  rr:predicate temp:longitude;
  rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "longitude"; rr:datatype xsd:double ]
].
```

All of the above results in the [mapping to intermediate](./workbench/config/source-to-intermediate.ttl) file. In order to make it available to the workbench container we need to use volume mapping again. However, becomes we know we'll need an additional file for transforming the intermediate to the target format, we choose to map the directory containing the mapping file as a whole: 

```yaml
volumes:
    - ./workbench/config:/ldio/config:ro
```

We also need to change our workbench pipeline to use the above RML mapping file and to include the RML mapping component (`RmlAdapter` instead of the `JsonLdAdapter` used in the basic setup). Our workbench pipeline input component is now complete and looks like this:

```yaml
input:
  name: be.vlaanderen.informatievlaanderen.ldes.ldio.LdioHttpInPoller
  config:
    url: https://data.stad.gent/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/real-time-bezetting-pr-gent/exports/csv?lang=en&timezone=Europe%2FBrussels
    interval: PT1M
  adapter:
    name: be.vlaanderen.informatievlaanderen.ldes.ldi.RmlAdapter
    config:
      mapping: ./config/source-to-intermediate.ttl
```

## Using the Swiss Army Knife
Now that we have an intermediate model as linked data we can use a [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) component which allows us to query the values in our intermediate model and [construct](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#construct) a target model.

If we look at our intermediate model and the target model we see that we need to keep the identity and type of our parking lot, convert the other properties to a different namespace and for some properties introduce the required structure:

|intermediate|target|
|-|-|
|temp:name _value_|rdfs:label _value_|
|temp:lastupdate _value_|dct:modified _value_|
|rdf:type mv:ParkingLot|_as-is_|
|temp:openingtimesdescription _value_|schema:openingHoursSpecification [rdf:type schema:OpeningHoursSpecification; rdfs:label _value_]|
|temp:operatorinformation _value_|mv:operatedBy [rdf:type schema:Organization, dct:Agent; rdfs:label _value_]|
|temp:freeparking _value_|mv:price [rdf:type schema:PriceSpecification; mv:freeOfCharge _value_ ]|
|_id_|mv:url _id_|
|temp:numberofspaces _value_|mv:capacity [rdf:type mv:Capacity; mv:totalCapacity _value_]|
|temp:availablespaces _value_|mv:capacity [rdf:type mv:RealTimeCapacity; mv:currentValue _value_]|
|temp:occupation _value_|mv:rateOfOccupancy _value_|
|temp:latitude _value_|geo:lat _value_|
|temp:longitude _value_|geo:long _value_|

So, let's start with the an empty SPARQL construct query (which is similar to a SPARQL query but the result is a new RDF model not just some values). Again, we use Turtle to do this:

```text
# TODO: add our prefixes here
CONSTRUCT {
  # TODO: add our target model here
} WHERE {
  # TODO: select the intermediate model values here
}
```

Not too difficult to understand: in, the `where` part we select values from the intermediate model and put them in variables. We then use those variables to create the target model in the `construct`part.

> **Note** that the casing of the words `construct` and `where` is not important.

Let's take a brief moment and look at the intermediate model. It is now linked data so we can look at this model as being a collection of id-property-value triples, where the id is the id of eack parking lot, the properties being the names in our `temp:` namespace and the values being values, obviously. In linked data we call this a `triple`. The `S` stands for `subject` (the identity of a thing), the `P` stands for `predicate` (a property identified by its unique full name, including the namespace) and the `O` stands for `object` (the value which can be literal or a reference to some other subject, with or without an actual identity). Conceptually, a triple is a way to represent a unidirectional, named relation between a subject and an object.

In linked data we also define the concept of a `graph`, which is just a tag for a triple and as such basically a way of grouping a bunch of triples together. It has no implicit meaning. A graph can be named by having an URI which identifies it. There's also one special unnamed graph (has no URI) which we call the default graph. When we add a graph part to a triple (`SPO`) we get a `quad` (`SPOG`). In fact, triples are just a special case of quads where the 4th component is the default graph. We can use graphs for many purposes, e.g. to identify the source of the triples, to group together all related entities, etc. But, we use graphs in our pipelines to split data containing multiple entities into a stream of entities that are processed one-by-one in the pipeline.

Wow, let's think about this for a moment: in linked data we model everything as a collection of (subject-predicate-object) triples. It allows us to look at SPARQL queries as being filters that select a subset of the triple collection. For example, if we need to select all the identities of our parking lots we can simply state that we look for all the triples for which the predicate is `rdf:type` and the object is `mv:ParkingLot`. The subjects of these triples are in fact what we search for: the identities. To express this in a SPARQL query we specify this as follows:

```text
?id <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.mobivoc.org/#ParkingLot>
```

The interesting part is the variable `?id`. It represents each result in our query. 

To make it more readable and in order to not repeat the namespace in every subject, predicate and object, we can again use prefixes:

```text
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX mv:  <http://schema.mobivoc.org/#>

?id rdf:type mv:ParkingLot
```

> **Note** that the syntax for our prefix definitions is slightly different: we use `PREFIX` instead of `@prefix` and there is no dot (`.`) at the end of the line.

The full SPARQL query would be:
```text
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX mv:  <http://schema.mobivoc.org/#>

SELECT ?id WHERE { ?id rdf:type mv:ParkingLot }
```

But we do not need the identities only. Instead we want to create a new collection of triples for each parking lot with the predicates changed to those needed by our target model. Let's start with simply copying the triple that defines our parking lots and their update timestamp:

```text
PREFIX rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX mv:   <http://schema.mobivoc.org/#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX temp: <https://temp.org/ns/advanced-compose#>

CONSTRUCT {
  ?id a mv:ParkingLot .
  ?id dct:modified ?lastupdate .
} WHERE {
  ?id rdf:type mv:ParkingLot .
  ?id temp:lastupdate ?lastupdate .
}
```

> **Note** that `a` is a short-hand notation of `rdf:type`.

In the `where` part we look for each `?id` which is a `mv:ParkingLot` and then we retrieve its value of `temp:lastupdate` as variable `?lastupdate`. Now that we have found these we can use the variables to create a new set of triples listed under the `construct` part. Not too difficult, is it?

Our target model is a bit more structured that our intermediate model, so at times we need to introduce an intermediate relation to some structure. Take for example the capacity. In the [model diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vocol/mobivoc/develop/diagrams/mobivoc_v1.1.4.png), we see that a _civic structure_ has a relation _has capacity_ to a _Capacity_ object that has a property _total capacity_. In linked data we model this as triples in this way:

```
<civic-structure-id> rdf:type schema:CivicStructure .
<civic-structure-id> mv:capacity <a-capacity> .
<a-capacity> rdf:type mv:Capacity .
<a-capacity> mv:totalCapacity "some-numeric-value"^^xsd:integer .
```

We see a very interesting difference between the _civic structure_ and its _capacity_: a _civic-structure_ has some unique identifier such as "https://example.org/id/civic-structure/parking-lot-1" but a _capacity_ is something that does not exist on its own, it is part of the _civic structure_ and does not have an identity of its own. In linked data we call this a _blank node_ because we can represent a triple as two nodes connected by a directed arrow, where the start node is a subject, the arrow is the predicate and the end node is the object. A _blank node_ is a node without an identity and can be both the source and the destination of one or more arrows, representing its relations aka. properties aka. predicates.

Because a blank node has no identity, we can write the above a bit more condensed by dropping the meaningless `<a-capacity>` and separating the predicates of the same subject by a semi-colon (`;`) - formatted for clarity:

```
<civic-structure-id> 
  rdf:type schema:CivicStructure ; 
  mv:capacity [ 
    rdf:type mv:Capacity ; 
    mv:totalCapacity "some-numeric-value"^^xsd:integer 
  ].
```

> **Note** that `[ ... ]` now represents our _capacity_.

Now that we have learned how to introduce structure in our target model we can create the [complete mapping](./workbench/config/intermediate-to-target.rq) using SPARQL construct and we need to add this transformation step in the workbench pipeline:

```yaml
transformers:
  - name: be.vlaanderen.informatievlaanderen.ldes.ldi.SparqlConstructTransformer
    config:
      query: ./config/intermediate-to-target.rq
```

In addition, as our target model has changed, we need to fix the transformation step which creates the version object to:

```yaml
  - name: be.vlaanderen.informatievlaanderen.ldes.ldi.VersionObjectCreator
    config:
      member-type: http://schema.mobivoc.org/#ParkingLot
      delimiter: "/"
      date-observed-property: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified>
      generatedAt-property: http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified
      versionOf-property: http://purl.org/dc/terms/isVersionOf
```

And also the [definition of the LDES](./definitions/occupancy.ttl) to reflect the correct target class:

```text
@prefix mv:          <http://schema.mobivoc.org/#>

</occupancy> a ldes:EventStream ;
	tree:shape [ a sh:NodeShape ; sh:targetClass mv:ParkingLot ] ;
```

> **Note** that in the [complete mapping](./workbench/config/intermediate-to-target.rq) when we query the properties from our source model that almost all of these query lines are wrapped by an `optional { ... }` construct. The reason for this is that any of these triples may be missing. Remember that the `WHERE` clause is in essence a filter on the collection of source triples, where each query line refines the subset of results from the previous query line. Therefore, if we do not use `optional` then the query returns no results and hence no target entity is constructed.

## Enough Talk, Show Me the Members
Now that we have set everything up, we can launch our systems. We cannot launch both our LDES server and our workbench at the same time because we are now polling for the data and our workbench pipeline will start immediately. This is a problem because we first need to send the definition of our LDES and view to the LDES server. Actually, it takes our LDES server longer to start than our workbench, so we need to prevent launching the workbench until our LDES server is up and running and we have seeded our definitions. To prevent our workbench to launch when we bring all our other systems up, we can add a `profile` to the [Docker compose](./docker-compose.yml) file in the workbench service. The actual name of the profile does not matter but we use `delay-started` to clearly communicate the purpose:

```yaml
ldio-workbench:
  container_name: advanced-conversion_ldio-workbench
  image: ghcr.io/informatievlaanderen/ldi-orchestrator:latest
  volumes:
    - ./workbench/config:/ldio/config:ro
    - ./workbench/application.yml:/ldio/application.yml:ro
  ports:
    - 9004:80
  networks:
    - advanced-conversion 
  profiles:
    - delay-started
```

To run the LDES server and its storage service (mongo), wait until its up and running, send definitions and then start the workbench:
```bash
clear

docker compose up -d
while ! docker logs $(docker ps -q -f "name=ldes-server$") 2> /dev/null | grep 'Started Application in' ; do sleep 1; done

curl -X POST -H "content-type: text/turtle" "http://localhost:9003/ldes/admin/api/v1/eventstreams" -d "@./definitions/occupancy.ttl"
curl -X POST -H "content-type: text/turtle" "http://localhost:9003/ldes/admin/api/v1/eventstreams/occupancy/views" -d "@./definitions/occupancy.by-page.ttl"

docker compose up ldio-workbench -d
while ! docker logs $(docker ps -q -f "name=ldio-workbench$") 2> /dev/null | grep 'Started Application in' ; do sleep 1; done
```

To verify the LDES, view and data:
```bash
clear
curl http://localhost:9003/ldes/occupancy
curl http://localhost:9003/ldes/occupancy/by-page
curl http://localhost:9003/ldes/occupancy/by-page?pageNumber=1
```

> **Note** that every two minutes the pipeline will request the latest state of our parking lots and will create additional version objects. The identity of a member depends only on the `lastupdate` property of our parking lot. If that did not change for a parking lot then the pipeline will create a version object with an identical identity as before. Any such version object will be refused by the LDES server and a warning will be logged in the LDES server log. The new version objects are added to the LDES and become new members.

## Every End is a New Beginning
You should now know some basics about linked data. You learned how to define a mapping from non-linked data to linked data using RML as well as how to transform a linked data model into a different linked data model. In addition, you learned that you can periodically pull data into a workbench pipeline to create a continuous stream of versions of the state of some system. You can now stop all the systems.

To bring the containers down and remove the private network:
```bash
docker compose rm ldio-workbench --stop --force --volumes
docker compose down
```

> **Note** that to bring down the workbench we need to stop it and remove the container and associated volumes explicitly because we started it separately.
